# 🕶️ AR/VR Interface Design – Intuitive User Experience

This project focuses on designing an intuitive **User Interface (UI)** for an **Augmented Reality (AR)** or **Virtual Reality (VR)** application. The design emphasizes natural interactions, spatial awareness, and user comfort within immersive environments.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create an interface for an AR/VR application that:
- Enhances **user engagement**
- Supports **gesture-based** or **gaze-based** interactions
- Maintains simplicity despite immersive complexity

---

## 🧩 Use Case Scenario

**App Concept:** Virtual Home Decor Planner  
Users can place, scale, and rearrange furniture within their real or virtual rooms using AR/VR.

---

## 🧠 Design Considerations

- 🎮 **Interaction Types:** Gesture controls, gaze-based selection, voice triggers
- 🧭 **Navigation:** Virtual joystick for movement, edge-scanning menus for tools
- 🪟 **UI Placement:** Floating UI panels that adjust based on user position and focus
- 🌐 **3D Feedback:** Animated haptics and visual cues to confirm actions

---

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **Figma** – UI layout and wireframes
- **Unity 3D** – Mockup prototyping
- **Blender** – 3D asset creation
- **Adobe XD** – For flow simulation
